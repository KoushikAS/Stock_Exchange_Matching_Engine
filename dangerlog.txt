Vulnerability taken care
1) We are using ORM (SQL Alchemy). Therefore SQL injecton is prevented.
2) Using Database (select by update) to handle race condition. Since Postgres DB is used to handle racecondition. we are confident that our code will not have a race condition. 

Potential Vulnerability
1) Having postgres db host and password in Docker compose file 
    However, we have mitigated this harm by running a docker container. So the user can't escalate their access to get the server system.
